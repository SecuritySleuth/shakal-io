# Shakal.io ðŸŽ­
## Peer-to-Peer video chat using WebRTC

> *NOTE:* If you're running this program either on the website shakal.projectvikrant.ga or on your localhost, do note that without a TURN relay server, this program will only work on your local network! Due to how symmetric NATs work, it is impossible as of now to set up a true peer-to-peer connection over the internet.

### Technology stack
1. React for web app.
2. NodeJS for http and ws signalling server.
3. Github Pages hosting.
